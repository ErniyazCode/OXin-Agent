Creating node endpoints
Follow the steps below to set up an endpoint and generate access tokens for your project.

This short guide shows you how to create an RPC endpoint (an RPC URL) for any supported protocol in your GetBlock Shared Node dashboard to connect it to your app, script, or wallet.

In GetBlock, an endpoint URL includes your unique Access Token — the credential that authenticates RPC requests. GetBlock’s UI sometimes labels the whole endpoint provisioning flow “Get Access Token” because a new RPC URL is created together with the token.

Access token management

GetBlock Deploys Major Security Upgrade: Introducing Access Tokens

The steps below cover how to generate a new endpoint URL with an Access Token:

Log in to your GetBlock account and navigate to the Dashboard

Find the Endpoints section on the Dashboard

Click Get endpoint to open the endpoint setup menu

GetBlock RPC endpoint setup interface
In the modal that opens, select:

The desired blockchain protocol (Ethereum, BNB Chain, Polygon, etc.)

The network you want to interact with: mainnet or testnet

Node mode: full (default) or archive

The API interface that you need (JSON-RPC, WebSockets, GraphQL, etc.)

One of the available server locations (Frankfurt, New York, or Singapore)

How to create a node endpoint for blockchain API access
Click 'Get' and have the endpoint URL with an access token generated.

Generate and add as many access tokens as required for this protocol. Each token is a unique endpoint for you and your application to interact with the blockchain.

All GetBlock endpoints follow a predictable format. The visible difference is the hostname reflecting the region selected during the setup.

Endpoint examples:


Copy
EU (Frankfurt):   https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/
US (New York):    https://go.getblock.us/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/
Asia (Singapore): https://go.getblock.asia/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/
The token encodes the protocol, networks, and routing on the server — clients don’t need to specify a chain in the URL.

Full vs Archive mode
When creating an endpoint in your GetBlock Dashboard, for select protocols, you can choose between two node access modes – Full and Archive. This selection determines how much historical blockchain data your endpoint can access.\

Full mode: Standard full (pruned) node behavior — current state lookups, sending transactions, reading blocks, etc.

Archive mode: Enables access to the historical chain state. Useful for querying balances, contract storage, UTXO sets, executing historical calls, simulating transactions at a past block, or reconstructing chain state for analytics and audits.

Selecting the Archive mode for an endpoint changes how requests are billed in Compute Units (CU). Learn more in the Archive mode guide.

Viewing and managing endpoints
The created URL is shown on the endpoints list so you can copy it and start calling the node. Use the right-side menu () to roll (regenerate) or delete the endpoint from the list.

Blockchain RPC nodes list within the GetBlock account
Because the Access Token is embedded, the URL is the credential. Keep it secret and store securely. If the URL is exposed, regenerate or revoke it from your GetBlock account.

Enabling archive mode
Enable Archive Mode on your GetBlock Shared Node API to access the full blockchain history and run historical queries

GetBlock provides direct access to blockchain historical states through both the Dedicated Nodes service and archive-enabled Shared RPC endpoints.

This page covers Archive Mode – a setting that turns on archive-node access within GetBlock’s Shared Nodes subscription.

Common RPC use cases enabled by Archive Mode:

Read contract/account state at any past block, not just latest , using methods like eth_getBalance(address, blockNumber), eth_getStorageAt(contract, slot, blockNumber), eth_getCode(address, blockNumber), etc.

Call view functions against historical state: e.g. eth_call(..., blockNumber).

Run historical queries and debugging that rely on old state: forensics, audits, explorers, indexing, and retroactive analytics.

Support tracing and higher-fidelity debugging that may require historical state.

This feature removes the need to run a dedicated archive infrastructure for some use cases, letting developers perform on-demand historical queries via GetBlock RPC API.

Archive mode availability & coverage
Archive functionality is included with all Shared Node subscriptions, excluding the Free plan. No additional fee required.

Archive support is provided for a set of popular protocol mainnets, including Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, Base, Arbitrum, TRON, Sui, Cardano, etc.

Look for the small history icon ( history/clock icon ) when picking a protocol during the endpoint setup. It indicates that Archive mode is available for that blockchain.

Archive blockchain data access via GetBlock RPC endpoints
If you need an archive data for a chain not covered by shared Archive mode, request a Dedicated Node. Dedicated Nodes can be deployed in archive mode for any supported blockchain and come with additional benefits like:

Full blockchain history at the highest throughput

Unlimited query capacity

Custom node builds & tooling

How to enable the Archive mode
Sign in to your GetBlock dashboard and make sure you’re on the Shared Node tab.

Click Get endpoint and choose a required blockchain protocol.

Get RPC endpoint button on GetBlock's dashboard
Find the Mode toggle and switch the Archive mode on.


Finish configuring endpoint details by choosing the API interface and server location as usual.

After clicking Get, the new Archive endpoint appears in your Endpoints list. The endpoint URLs will follow the existing GetBlock format but point to archive nodes.

CU billing for Shared Archive endpoints
Archive endpoints usage remains subject to your plan’s CU limits and performance characteristics.

However, serving requests from archive infrastructure involves heavier storage and compute power compared to regular full nodes.

Therefore, enabling the Archive mode affects how CU usage is calculated:

GetBlock applies a 2× Compute Unit (CU) multiplier to all requests made through the Archive endpoint.

The multiplier is applied to all requests made to an archive endpoint, even if the invoked RPC call does not require a historical state.

You can review the per-chain CU values for each method on our Compute Units page.

Example:

If eth_getBalance costs 20 CU on a standard shared endpoint for a given chain, the same call to an Archive-enabled shared endpoint will cost 40 CU.

Plan accordingly and consider using standard Full mode endpoints for non-archive traffic to avoid unnecessary CU consumption.

Best practices
Use archive endpoints only for workloads that require a historical state. For transactions or current state queries, use a standard Full mode to save CU.

Monitor CU consumption on the dashboard and set alerts for spikes or when usage nears your plan limit.

If you run sustained, high-volume archive queries, consider using a Dedicated Node.

Dedicated node performance tiers
Last updated 5 days ago

Dedicated node performance tiers
GetBlock’s Dedicated Nodes are available in two performance tiers – High and Standard. Choose the right balance of performance and cost for your private infrastructure

Dedicated Nodes are fully private blockchain nodes deployed and managed for your team. With two distinct performance presets, you can balance throughput, SLA, and budget to fit your workload.

Available tiers:

High Performance Tier: Designed to provide maximum available resources, throughput, and reliability. It is intended for applications where performance and availability are critical. The focus is on delivering the highest service levels and supporting the most demanding production workloads.

Standard Performance Tier: Designed to offer enterprise-grade performance sufficient for the majority of professional and business use cases, but at a more cost-efficient level. It targets demanding business applications and sustained usage, but without the additional (and sometimes excessive) headroom reserved for High Performance tier.

By providing these options, GetBlock helps you to deploy Dedicated Nodes that are tailored to your application’s technical, operational, and budget requirements.

Dedicated Node tiers overview
When deploying a Dedicated Node, you can choose between High and Standard setups to align with your application’s resource needs and expected workload.

Select High if your workload is latency-sensitive, demands very high concurrent throughput, or is critical to business continuity.

Select Standard for typical production apps, where workload is within supported performance bounds.

Configuring tiers is available for all supported protocols unless there are specific infrastructure limitations for a given network. In this case, a chain will only support a single tier.

Always check available configurations in your dashboard

Using GetBlock configuration files
GetBlock’s configuration file provides a more organized and flexible way to interact with blockchain nodes and networks without exposing sensitive API keys or credentials in the code.

How to make HTTP requests with curl using JSON config file
Using GetBlock’s JSON configuration file with curl is particularly helpful when you need to access various node endpoints without hardcoding API keys in the code:

Download the getblock.config.json file from your GetBlock account;

Make sure you have jq installed. jq is a versatile command-line tool that enables extracting values from JSON files;

Navigate to your workspace or directory where you have imported the getblock.config.json file and open a terminal;

Now, you can make a GET request to a selected node endpoint using the curl command:


Copy
curl -X GET https://go.getblock.io/"$(jq -r '.shared.btc.mainnet.rest[0]' getblock.config.json)"/rest/chaininfo.json
How to use GetBlock’s JavaScript config with Web3.js
Connect to Ethereum nodes and other EVM-compatible networks using web3.js and GetBlock’s JS configuration file.

Make sure the web3.js library is added to your project. In order to do that, use one of the following methods:

Npm: npm install web3

Yarn: yarn add web3

Pure js link: dist/web3.min.js

Download the getblock.config.js file from your GetBlock account. Add this file to your project directory.

Import the getblock module to a .js file that configures a new Web3 instance:


Copy
const { getblock } = require('./getblock.config.js');
Connect to an Ethereum node and start sending API calls using web3.js over HTTP or WebSocket in the format below:


Copy
const { getblock } = require('./getblock.config.js');
var Web3 = require('web3');

// Create the JSON-RPC provider
var web3Rpc = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider(
        getblock.shared.eth.mainnet.rpc[0].go()
));

// Create the WebSocket provider
var web3Ws = new Web3.providers.WebsocketProvider(
        `wss://go.getblock.io/${getblock.shared.eth.mainnet.ws[0].token()}`
));
Use go() method to access an entire endpoint or token() to fetch the token.

How to use the JS config with Hardhat
Set up GetBlock’s JS config file in Hardhat following the steps below:

Ensure you have Hardhat installed as a dependency in your Node.js project or run the following command to do so:


Copy
npm install --save-dev hardhat
Navigate to your GetBlock account and install the getblock.config.js file. Copy and paste it into your working directory;

Open the hardhat.config.js file from your project directory and import the getblock module:


Copy
const { getblock } = require('./getblock.config.js');
To set up GetBlock as a provider, modify the Hardhat configuration file with the credentials as shown below. Use go() method to access an entire endpoint or token() to fetch the token only.


Copy
const { getblock } = require('./getblock.config.js'); 

module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "sepolia",
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
    },
    sepolia: {
      url: getblock.shared.eth.sepolia.rpc[0].go() // https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/
    },
    goerli: {
      url: `https://go.getblock.io/${getblock.shared.eth.goerli.rpc[0].token()}` // <ACCESS-TOKEN>
    },
  },
  solidity: {
    version: "0.8.19",
    settings: {
      optimizer: {
        enabled: true,
        runs: 200
      }
    }
  },
  paths: {
    sources: "./contracts",
    tests: "./test",
    cache: "./cache",
    artifacts: "./artifacts"
  },
  mocha: {
    timeout: 40000
  }
}

Using cURL for testing
These examples provide a starting point for testing your connection and querying blockchain data using cURL commands.

Before you start:

Create a JSON-RPC endpoint for the Ethereum blockchain from your GetBlock account.

Replace <ACCESS_TOKEN> in the examples below with your actual Access Token.

Fetch the current block number
Run the following command to retrieve the latest block number:


Copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_blockNumber",
    "params": [],
    "id": "getblock.io"
}'
If successful, the response will include the current block number in hexadecimal value:


Copy
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "getblock.io",
    "result": "0x1449641"
}
Get the chain ID
Identify the blockchain network with the eth_chainId method:


Copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_chainId",
    "params": [],
    "id": "getblock.io"
}'
Response example:


Copy
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "getblock.io",
  "result": "0x1"
}
In this example, 0x1 indicates the Ethereum Mainnet. The chain ID helps confirm which blockchain network you are interacting with.

Check account balance by address
Retrieve the balance of an Ethereum address using eth_getBalance. Replace <ACCOUNT_ADDRESS> with the target wallet address:


Copy
curl --location --request POST 'https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS_TOKEN>/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "method": "eth_getBalance",
    "params": ["<ACCOUNT_ADDRESS>", "latest"],
    "id": "getblock.io"
}'
Example response:


Copy
{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "getblock.io",
    "result": "0x5a70dac3910910"
}
The result field shows the account balance in wei (1 ether = 10¹⁸ wei).

Postman Collection
Download the Postman GetBlock’s collection to test our service. It includes all the accessible endpoints of our nodes and ready-to-go examples.

Import the collection into your Postman workspace: https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/28751185/2s9YRDzqcX.

Web3.js integration
Learn how to use Web3.js, a widely-used JavaScript library for connecting to GetBlock nodes.

Web3.js is a JavaScript library built for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and other EVM-compatible chains. It is used to send JSON-RPC calls to the Ethereum node via HTTP, IPC, or WebSocket connection to read data from the blockchain, make transactions, or deploy smart contracts.

Install Web3.js
Use your preferred package manager:

npm:


Copy
npm install web3
yarn:


Copy
yarn add web3
Pure js link:


Copy
dist/web3.min.js
Set up your connection to GetBlock

Copy
// Import the Web3 library
const Web3 = require('web3');

// Set GetBlock as the provider (replace ACCESS_TOKEN with your actual token)
var web3 = new Web3('https://go.getblock.io/ACCESS_TOKEN');

// Initialize web3 method
web3.eth.getBlockNumber().then(console.log);

How to generate accounts and send transactions
This guide explains how GetBlock users can connect to blockchain nodes to create accounts and send transactions.

In blockchains, ‘account’ should be referred to as a pair of private and public keys. Blockchains ‘recognize’ their users and balances by these keypairs.

Unlike login/password pairs in traditional computational solutions, in modern blockchains, every account can be restored with a private key only.

So, to broadcast transactions to a decentralized network, we need first to create (or restore) our account. The whole set of interactions is organized via Web3.js library.

Creating accounts
First, initialize the Web3.js library and set up the connection to a blockchain node:


Copy
const Web3 = require('web3');

//Set up the provider (replace ACCESS-TOKEN with your actual token)
const web3 = new Web3('https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/');
Next, we can create an account on the BNB Smart Chain testnet:


Copy
// Generate new address and private key
const accountTo = web3.eth.accounts.create();
console.log('Generated account:', accountTo);
We can also restore an account from an existing private key:


Copy
// Restore account from private key
const privateKey = process.env['privateKey'];
const accountFrom = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount(privateKey);
You may ask what does ‘eth’ mean when we’re interacting with BNB Chain? No mistake, it reflects the fact that BNB Smart Chain is fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine.

Sending transactions
In blockchains, transactions should be signed (authorized) to be ‘included’ into blockchains (confirmed by its consensus of miners or validators).

Here’s how our transactions are created. 0.01 ETH is used for demo.


Copy
const createSignedTx = async (rawTx) => {
rawTx.gas = await web3.eth.estimateGas(rawTx);
return await accountFrom.signTransaction(rawTx);
}

const sendSignedTx = async (signedTx) => {
// You can use signedTx.rawTransaction as params for
// calling eth_sendRawTransaction JSON-RPC method
web3.eth.sendSignedTransaction(signedTx.rawTransaction).then(
console.log
);
}

const amountTo = "0.01" // ether
That’s how the transaction looks before being included in the blockchain. Once signed, it can be sent to the network of nodes.


Copy
const rawTx = {
to: accountTo.address,
value: web3.utils.toWei(amountTo, 'ether'),
chainId: chainId
};

createSignedTx(rawTx).then(sendSignedTx)

Solana (SOL)
GetBlock Solana RPC API documentation: JSON-RPC reference, WebSocket subscriptions, and connection guides for mainnet & devnet endpoints

GetBlock provides RPC endpoints that implement the Solana JSON-RPC API standard. These methods are core functionalities for interacting with Solana nodes, enabling seamless integration with the Solana blockchain.

Overview of Solana Network Methods
The Solana network offers a comprehensive suite of methods that enable developers to interact seamlessly with its blockchain infrastructure. This overview provides an in-depth examination of these methods, categorizing them into key functional areas for better understanding and implementation.

What you can expect to find in this documentation:

import axios from "axios";

const url = `https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/`;
const payload = {
  jsonrpc: '2.0',
  id: 1,
  method: 'getBalance',
  params: ['<ACCOUNT-PUBKEY>']
};

axios.post(url, payload)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Account balance:', response.data.result.value);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error(error);
  });
Replace <ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from GetBlock, and <ACCOUNT-PUBKEY> with the public key of the account you wish to query.

Copy
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
Install the requests library:


Copy
pip install requests
Write Your First Script

Create a new file called main.py and insert the following code:


Copy
import requests

# Replace <ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from GetBlock
url = "https://go.getblock.io/<ACCESS-TOKEN>/"

# Create a JSON-RPC payload
payload = {
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "getBalance",
    "params": ["<ACCOUNT-PUBKEY>"]
}

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

try:
    # Send the POST request
    response = requests.post(url, json=payload, headers=headers)
    response.raise_for_status()  # Check for HTTP errors
    data = response.json()

    # Print the account balance
    balance = data["result"]["value"]
    print(f"Account balance: {balance}")
except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
except KeyError:
    print("Unexpected response format:", response.text)
Replace <ACCESS-TOKEN> with your actual API key from GetBlock, and <ACCOUNT-PUBKEY> with the public key of the account you wish to query.

Run Your Script
