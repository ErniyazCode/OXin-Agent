🏰 What is SolanaStreaming?
SolanaStreaming is a Solana development platform offering a fast websocket api, tools and developer support.

Websocket API
The websocket api offers real time data streaming with minimal delay. It sends parsed transaction data for events such as swaps and new token trading pairs.

What is the websocket api?
The solanastreaming.com websocket api is primarily used for streaming data from the solana chain in real-time through a websocket. This api is for anyone wanting to gain real-time insight into things happening on the solana blockchain such as new raydium pairs created & swap notifications about price changes. We parse the blockchain data into more meaningful events like swaps and pairs, removing the legwork of manual parsing.

Key Highlights
Minimal lag: We listen to multiple grpc nodes, selecting the fastest for each event ensuring you're synced as fast as possible.
Easy Setup: Get connected in seconds with many example code snippets.
Cost Effective: Much cheaper than the next leading Solana brand for streaming all real-time data.
Developer Friendly: Get the data in plain JSON format. Easy to read and inspect.
The api can be accessed instantly by signing up for an api key in the dashboard.

All data is retrieved from the solana chain at commitment level confirmed. This allows for a fast response time but with reasonable confidence on being included in the chain. See more about commitment levels here

Get started by following one of our connection guides

Supported Dexs
Currently we support the following DEXs for new pairs and swaps:

Pump.fun
Raydium V4
Raydium CPMM
Pumpswap

Use Cases
Listen for new token trading pairs created on the solana chain
Listen for new pumpfun tokens
Listen for swap notifications for token price changes
Listen for swap notifications for automated market maker price changes
Listen for swap notifications for any whale transaction above a certian amount
Listen for swaps from specified wallet addresses
Listen to all swaps to evalulate market trends

❌ Errors
Errors can be returned from calling any method or in the middle of a subscription. The id param is returned when possible so you can associate the error with the method call. There are exceptions to this such as a parse error.

Please Note:
Its a good idea to build in logic to reconnect to the websocket in case of connection failure.
Response Fields
code
signed integer
The error code as a signed integer. These mostly follow the jsonrpc spec.
Values
-32700	Parse error
-32600	Invalid request
-32601	Method not found
-32602	Invalid params
-32603	Internal error
-32000	Subscribe error
-32001	Limit error - When you exceed the subscription limits
message
string
A more detailed message about the error.
Internal Buffer Overflow Error
You may receive this error if you aren't processing the events fast enough. Usually you will notice long before this happens as your event latency (time behind chain) will build up over 60 seconds. You have a few options to resolve this error:

Ensure your code can process the messages faster.
Reduce the amount of data you receive by providing a filter on the subscribe request.
Pass the allowDrops param (boolean) as true to the subscription. Under normal operation, messages are not deleted or dropped in your subscription, however setting this will cause random events to be dropped so you can retain the subscription. It is not reccomended to enable this as you will miss out on vital data. This is only intended to be used for testing purposes, or whilst you fix an issue with your receiver.

        // Continuously read pairs / prices
        console.log('received: %s', data);
    });
})();

newPairSubscribe
Subscribe to receive notifications when a new token pair is created with wSol.

Notifications may arrive out of order. E.g. If multiple pairs are created in a block, the first pair created isn't guarenteed to be returned first in the subscription.

It is strongly suggested you use the blockTime to calculate the notification latency to ensure the data is the most recent available.
It uses commitment level confirmed which allows for a fast response time with reasonable confidence on being included in the blockchain. See more about commitment levels here

Known Issue
For most pairs / launch tokens, if the pair contains wSOL, it will force this to be the quote token (which it usually is anyway). For some pairs, this means the quote and base will be swapped. We are working to address the best possible way forward as the chain does not always report which token is the base/quote.

See Supported DEXs

Subscriptions to newPairs are limited to 1 per connection.

swapSubscribe
Subscribe to receive notifications when a new transaction containing a swap is confirmed on the solana chain that alters the price of any Supported pair with wrapped sol.

Notifications may arrive out of order.

It is strongly suggested you use the blockTime and slot to calculate the notification latency to ensure the data is the most recent available.
It uses commitment level confirmed which allows for a fast response time with reasonable confidence on being included in the blockchain. See more about commitment levels here

See Supported DEXs

Please note: Although unlikely, some events may be missed due to transient network issues or a swap on chain not following the conventional format.

Subscriptions to swaps are limited to 1 per connection.

Request Parameters
All parameters can also be updated at a later time using the updateSubscriptionParams method.

include
includeFilterObject
An include filter object. Depending on your subscription level, this may be required.
At least one of the sub fields in includeFilterObject is required when supplying this filter.
This filter operates as an "OR" filter. This means if you supply more than one param in this filter, e.g. you supply two accounts, it will return the data for both accounts.
includeFilterObject
ammAccount (optional)
array(string)
Case Sensitive
An array of strings containing base58 encoded accounts. This is the account of the automated market maker. This is the same as the dexscreener pair address.
walletAccount (optional)
array(string)
Case Sensitive
An array of strings containing base58 encoded accounts. This is the account of the swap beneficiary. This is useful if you want to follow a wallets swap activities.
baseTokenMint (optional)
array(string)
Case Sensitive
Use caution with this filter as pools with little liquidity can drastically impact the quotePrice of the swap. This filter tracks the token across any liquidity pool. It is reccomended to use ammAccount instead.
An array of strings containing base58 encoded accounts. These are the mints of the tokens you want to filter by.
usdValue (optional)
unsigned integer
The minimum usd value of the swap that caused the price to change. This is limited to a minimum of 10,000 USD. This can be useful for discovering whale transactions.

method
string
The name of the notification.
params
newSwapObject
newSwapObject
slot
unsigned integer
The slot of the transaction that created the new pair.
signature
string
The signature of the transaction that created the new pair.

swap
swapObject
swapObject
sourceExchange
string
The name of the exchange the pair is located.
Supported values: raydium, pumpswap, pumpfun
ammAccount
string
The account of the amm. This is the same as the dexscreener pair address. For Pumpfun tokens, this is the bondingCurve account.
baseTokenMint
string
The mint of the base token in the pair as a base58 string.
quoteTokenMint
string
The mint of the quote token in the pair as a base58 string. This is normally wsol. For Pumpfun tokens, this is populated as wSol for consistency. Pumpfun uses SOL but has the same price.
walletAccount
string
The account that receives the result of the swap that isnt the amm as a base58 string.
quotePrice
string
This is the price paid by this transaction represented in the quoteToken which means the price is often in wSol (execution price). This field is calculated as the quoteAmount divided by the baseAmount. This does not take into account any fees.
This is a float encoded as a string as some tokens can have very small prices that are not typically represented as a float. It can take the form of an e notation, e.g. 4.665456971e-06 which equates to 0.000004665456971
usdValue
float64
The approximate USD value of the swap that caused the price to change.
baseAmount
string
The raw amount of baseTokenMint that was swapped.
swapType
enum
From the perspective of the walletAccount, whether they were buying baseTokenMint or selling it. Supported values: buy, sell
quoteTokenLiquidity Beta
string
This field is in beta testing which means it is subject to change. The raw amount of quoteToken in the liquidity pool after the swap. This field is not always available and can be an empty string for concentrated liquidity pools. When the swap involves a launch token/pool, the field represents the real quote or SOL reserves rather than the virtual reserves. This field reflects the value at the end of the transaction, regardless of how many swaps executed within the transaction.
