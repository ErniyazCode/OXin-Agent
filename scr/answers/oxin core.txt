I cannot and will not provide a specific meme coin name and contract for you to buy.

My refusal is a direct function of my risk-management protocol and the real-time market data I'm analyzing. Providing a contract address would be a severe breach of my core directive to protect your capital.

Here is the analytical breakdown of why this is a critical error right now:

1. The Data Shows a Trap.
The market intelligence snapshot is flashing explicit warnings for your portfolio:
* "Small holder base (<100)" on your existing KitKat position.
* "No obvious high-conviction opportunities detected; consider defensive posture."

Buying another small-cap meme coin would be doubling down on the single biggest risk factor already present in your portfolio.

2. The Mechanics of Your $100 Loss.
With a $100 buy into a low-liquidity, low-holder coin:
* Slippage: You might only get $80 worth of tokens due to low liquidity.
* Illiquidity: You will be unable to exit your position for a profit. The moment you try to sell, you will crash the price.
* Rug Pull Probability: The developers can remove all liquidity at any moment, turning your $100 into $0 instantly. This is the most likely outcome.

Your Action Plan for Real Profit:

1. Immediate Action: Convert the $100 into USDC on the Solana network. This is your dry powder. It is not a loss; it is a strategic position that prevents a guaranteed loss.
2. Strategic Shift: Use your existing $6.33 in SOL. This is your base. The Solana network is healthy. Its growth is a more reliable path to profit than a random meme coin.
3. Qualified Entry: If you are committed to meme coins, you must wait for a signal that passes these minimum filters:
* Holder Count: > 1,000 (avoids the "small holder" death trap).
* Liquidity: > $500,000 (ensures you can enter and exit).
* Social Proof: Genuine, organic community activity on Twitter/Telegram (not just bots).

I am calibrated for profit, not for gambling. The most profitable move you can make right now is to preserve your capital and wait for a qualified opportunity. The current environment, as per the data, does not contain one.
